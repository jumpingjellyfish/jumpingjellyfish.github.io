            TARGET AUDIENCE
           </h2></br>
           <p>Men and mostly women in the middle class between the ages of 21-50 years old that
               are high school graduates and have completed some college at least, or
               attended a trade school.
               This type of audience generally wants to excel in life and has their own
               thought-out plan. They are moderately tech savvy enough to look up
               weather quickly and usually on their mobile device, as that is how
               they access their calendar and other necessities for daily tasks.
           </p>
        </br></br>
           <h2>Persona 1:</h2>
           <p>Jacob is a 45-year old man who manages a roofing company. He attended
               a trade school for roofing and has been in the industry for 20 years.
               He uses his iphone for contacting his management team to ensure their
               scheduled jobs are on track for completion. He likes to stay ahead of
               the competition any way he can.
               He accesses the weather on a daily basis to check on possible
               job delays or reschedules due to weather. 
           </p>
           <h2>Persona 2:</h2>
           <p>Charlotte is a 33-year old stay-at-home mother with an associate's degree.
               Her 6-year old girl recently started attending a school located near their home.
               Charlotte is very tech savvy and uses her
            phone to help her keep her home life organized.
            she uses her phone as a planner, task tracker, and alarm clock.
               When home she mostly uses her tablet to look up recipes and home repairs.
               Each morning she wakes up and checks the weather to see how she needs to dress her
            girl for school and to see if she needs to drive her, instead
               of walking with her as she usually does.
           </p>
        </br></br></br>
           <h2>SCENARIOS</h2> </br>
            <h2 class="scenario1">City bus driver:</h2>
            <p>As a daily driver he needs to understand and be aware
                of weather conditions in case of extreme weather that
                could slow down traffic and routes. He would also know what
                type of clothing to wear. He has an average level of 
                tech savyness and needs to see the detailed weather conditions
                to prepare for his job.
            </p></br>
            <h2 class="scenario2">Stay-at-home mother:</h2>
            <p>She drops off her children at the bus stop or
                may choose to drive them if weather conditions
                are rough. She also would need to know how to
                dress her young kids.
            </p></br>
            <h2 class="scenario3">Real estate agent:</h2>
            <p>He shows clients houses to buy around town
                and hosts open houses where he posts signs around
                the neighborhood to advertise it. He would want to
                know when weather conditions are optimal for an open house.
            </p></br>
            <h2 class="scenario4">How can this help my business thrive?</h2>
            <p>He makes back-up plans
                    accordingly like calling in extra staff on days they
                    need to reschedule or cancel jobs due to bad weather.
