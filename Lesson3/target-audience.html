            TARGET AUDIENCE
           </h2></br>
           <p>Men and mostly women in the middle class between the ages of 21-50 years old that
               are high school graduates and have completed some college at least, or
               attended a trade school.
               This type of audience generally wants to excel in life and has their own
               thought-out plan. They are moderately tech savvy enough to look up
               weather quickly and usually on their mobile device, as that is how
               they access their calendar and other necessities to accomplish daily tasks.
           </p>
        </br></br>
           <h2>Persona 1:</h2>
           <p>Jacob is a 45-year old man who manages a roofing company. He attended
               a trade school for roofing and has been in the industry for 20 years.
               It's taken time but he finds his iphone useful now and it for contacting his management team to ensure their
               scheduled jobs are on track for completion. He likes to stay ahead of
               the competition any way he can. He wants to ensure a secure financial future for his family of 4.
               In the early mornings he accesses the weather from his iphone, while still in bed, to check on possible
               job delays or necessary reschedules due to bad weather. 
           </p></br>
           <h2>Persona 2:</h2>
           <p>Charlotte is a 33-year old stay-at-home mother with an associate's degree in business.
               Her 6-year old girl recently started attending a school located near their home.
               Charlotte is very tech savvy and uses her
            android phone to help her keep her home life organized.
            she uses her phone as a planner, task tracker, and alarm clock.
               When home she mostly uses her tablet to look up recipes and home repairs.
               Each morning she wakes up and checks the weather to see how she needs to dress her
            girl for school and to see if she needs to drive her, instead
               of walking with her as she usually does.
           </p>
        </br></br></br>
           <h2>-SCENARIOS-</h2> </br>
            <h2>How can this help the average employee?</h2>
            <p>As a daily driver you need to understand and be aware
                of weather conditions in case of extreme weather that
                could slow down traffic and make you late for work. You would
                also know how to dress outside and inside your
                office building so you can feel well and perform at your best.
            </p></br>
            <h2>Can this help me have a low-stress home life?</h2>
            <p>Parents drop off their children at the school bus stop or
                may choose to drive them if weather conditions
                are rough. They also would need to know how to
                dress their young kids.
            </p></br>
            <h2>Does my income depend on the weather?</h2>
            <p>A real estate agent shows his clients houses to buy around town
                and hosts open houses that he posts signs around
                the neighborhood to advertise. The weather can make or
                breaks his day with showings and open houses. He would want to
                know when weather conditions cause difficulty in travel
                so he can plan his days when visibility and travel are good.
            </p></br>
            <h2>How can this help my business thrive?</h2>
            <p>This weather site will allow people like Jacob, whose business
                depends on the weather conditions, to be well-informed and
                use weather information to avoid disaster situations thus
                bringining in more customers. He will also be able to stay
                well-organized with the employees on call. If a need arises
                where more bodies are needed at the office, or on the field,
                he can call in extra staff on days they are
                extra busy rescheduling jobs due to bad weather.
            </p></br>
            <h2>Improved grades in school?</h2>
            <p>A college student needs weather information to know if she needs to leave
            home early to be on time for class. She also needs to know how to dress properly,
            while making sure her books/laptop are properly covered for her walk
            through campus to her class. Having a succesful class depends on her
            arriving to class prepared and not distracted by possible extreme
            weather conditions damaging her school materials and clothes.</p>
            </br>
            <h2>Reducing unnecessary costs.</h2>
            <p>Outdoor businesses, like landscaping companies, thrive on
                weather conditions. When there is a job scheduled that involves
                an outdoor installation, if they don't check the weather they
                could face having to re-do a lot of jobs just due to bad weather
                conditions and that will cost the company twice as much.
